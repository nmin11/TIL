_AWS Cloud Development Kit_

## Overview

- Define cloud infrastructure using a familiar language
  - JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, Java, .NET
- SAM defines CloudFormation as a YML file, but CDK defines it as code
- CDK code is "compiled" into a CloudFormation template (JSON/YAML)
- Includes high level components called **constructs**
- **Infrastructure code and application runtime code can be deployed together**
  - Great for Lambda functions
  - Great for Docker containers in ECS/EKS
